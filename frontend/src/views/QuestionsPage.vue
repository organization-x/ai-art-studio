      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: How do you use Keyo's Canvas?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: Using the tools on the side of the canvas you can choose to draw,
        erase, ect. After you feel that your art is complete you can press the
        send icon(paper plane) and that will shoot your image through the AI, to
        get an auto generated result. After that you can save the image by two
        finger clicking on the image and pressing the save button to save it to
        your computor. And if you feel the urg to draw again, above the image
        you just generated there is a button that allows you to do. just that
      </p>

      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: Which tools are which? How can you tell?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: The way to decipher the tools on the side of your canvas is to hover
        over them for a bit and a their name will show up above explaining their
        use. If you need a key though here it is:
      </p>
      <p>Paintbrush --> Drawing Utensil</p>
      <p>Eraser --> Eraser</p>
      <p>Pallet --> Color of your Paintbrush</p>
      <p>Bucket --> Fill Background</p>
      <p>Trash Can --> Deletes the Whole Drawing</p>
      <p>
        Airplane --> Sends of Drawing to AI to get to the Generated Image page
      </p>

      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: What is the Text to Image?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: The text to image below the canvas on the canvas page, gives the AI
        more direction. Think of it like you have a map to get home but it
        doen't have any captions, just a map of the landscape. It would probably
        be a lot easier to get where you are going with labels on the map
        telling you which street you should turn at. It's The same thing with
        the AI, sure it can take what you drew, and turn it into an image but
        you are not garented the best results with it. So we at KEYO Art Studio
        recomend you use the text to image feature if you have a specific idea
        of what you want you image to look like.
      </p>
      <p class="fw-light">
        One more thing to add on is that if you are looking for a specific kind
        of art style you should also metion that in the text to image. This is
        so the AI can add that in to it's equation. One example of this is if
        you wanted to draw a bubble but you also wanted it to be realistic as
        well, you could put realistic bubble into the text to image, creating a
        better image.
