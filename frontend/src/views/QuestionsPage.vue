      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: How do you use Keyo's Canvas?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: Using the tools on the side of the canvas you can choose to draw,
        erase, etc. After you feel that your art is complete, add a prompt to
        guide the generation, then press the send icon (paper plane) and that
        will shoot your image through the AI, to get an auto generated result.
        You can save your generated image by two finger clicking on the image
        and pressing the save button to save it to your computor. And if you
        feel the urge to draw again, above the image you just generated you can
        head back to the canvas page.
      </p>

      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: Which tools are which? How can you tell?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: You can hover over each tool to get an indication on what they are.
      </p>
      <p>Paintbrush --> Drawing Utensil</p>
      <p>Eraser --> Eraser</p>
      <p>Pallet --> Color of your Paintbrush</p>
      <p>Bucket --> Fill Background</p>
      <p>Trash Can --> Deletes the Whole Drawing</p>
      <p>
        Airplane --> Sends of Drawing to AI to get to the Generated Image page
      </p>

      <h3 class="fw-lighter">Q: What is Text to Image?</h3>
      <p class="fw-light">
        A: The textbox below the canvas, gives the AI more direction. Think of
        it like you have a map to get home but it doen't have any captions, just
        a map of the landscape. It would probably be a lot easier to get where
        you are going with labels on the map telling you which street you should
        turn at. It's The same thing with the AI, sure it can take what you
        drew, and turn it into an image but you are not garented the best
        results with it. So we at KEYO Art Studio recomend you use the text to
        image feature if you have a specific idea of what you want you image to
        look like, otherwise the AI may interpret the input in unexpected ways.
        If you're looking for a specific kind of art style, mention that in the
        prompt! Try adjectives like "photorealistic" or "cartoon".
